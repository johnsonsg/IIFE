# IIFE - Immediately-Invoked Function Expression

* Pronounced "Iffy" by Ben Alman who introduced the acronym

## Variations

### with anonymous arrow functions inside: 
```
(() => {
// do stuff
})();

(() -> {
// When the arrow function is contained by Paranthesis that is what makes it an IIFE
})

The Paranthesis at the end (), this is the operator that calls it into action.
so when the function has no name like this it is immediately invoked. 
```
